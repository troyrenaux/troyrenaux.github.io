My name is Troy Renaux and I am a Junior Communication major at Bob Jones University. I am also working on a graphic design degree at BJU. Right now I am working at
<a href="https://signenterprise.com/">Sign Enterprise</a>
designing signs and other graphics. At the same time I am taking this class and also doing a little bit of graphic design freelancing.

As far as hobbies go, I really enjoy playing board games. My favorite game is called 
<a href="https://stonemaiergames.com/games/scythe/">Scythe</a>
and is is basically a mixture between Settlers of Catan and Risk.
